The purpose of this repo is to inspire an organized setup of well written and documented configurations for my personal desktop environment.
At the time of writing I'm using Arch with BSPWM, however this repo is made with the intention of simplifying DistroHopping somewhat.

This project uses a Trunk Based Development branching schema such that **main** should always contain the source code of working and debugged configurations.
See releases for stable versions.
